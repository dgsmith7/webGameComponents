# webGameComponenets

TODO - forgot this uses modules when I moved and pushed - need to fix this.

I am trying to build some webgame componenets for use in future projects. 

Character controller:
Following this guide, roughly. by SimonDev:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkPfhzIbp2g

I used Mixamo for gltf animations: https://www.mixamo.com/#/

I used this tool to add animations to model into one file:  https://nilooy.github.io/character-animation-combiner/

I used this model for character:  https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/anatomy/wooden-mannequin-for-artists

I used an image of my own painting for the texture.

Third person cam:
I haven't started it yet but eventually plan to use SimonDev video in future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuNPHOJ_V5o

I am likely to go with FPS view though, in which case I would not need either one.


There are lot of other things I am still learning that will go into this repo.  The idea is to have a code library I can use as boilerplate on many projects.
